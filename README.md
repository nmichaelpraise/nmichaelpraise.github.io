This page illustrates procedures of Locating and running existing code for *Volume casting* and *Marching cube*

- First step was to identify implementation that arleady exists on Github
  Among others, [*PyMCubes*](https://github.com/pmneila/PyMCubes) had an implementation of the marching cubes algorithm to extract
iso-surfaces from volumetric data using python. this was interesting based on my experience with python. For the case of Volume casting, [*Raycasting-volume-rendering*](https://github.com/rhnfzl/raycasting-volume-rendering) had python methods for colume cast rendering

- Second step was cloning the repositories so as I can try them locally
  I achieved this by using Github Desktop which has the great user interface and abilities to interact with github.

- Third step was installing all relevant packages required for the code to run. Here I installed numphy
